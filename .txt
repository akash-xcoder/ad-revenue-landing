By using this Website, you represent and warrant that you are at least 16 years old and of legal age to form a binding contract with Almedia and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. IF YOU DO NOT MEET ALL OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.

Participation on the Website is limited to only one (1) account per person and only (1) account per household.

3. Changes to the Terms of Services
We may revise and update these Terms of Services from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. HOWEVER, ANY CHANGES TO THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION WILL NOT APPLY TO ANY DISPUTES FOR WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE ACTUAL NOTICE ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE THE CHANGE IS POSTED ON THE WEBSITE. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of revised Terms of Services means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

4. Access to Use of Our Website
Subject to all of the provisions of these Terms of Services, Almedia hereby grants you a limited, terminable, non-transferable, personal, non-exclusive right to access and use the Website solely as provided herein. You agree to use our Website only for purposes that are permitted by these Terms of Services and any applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practices in the relevant jurisdictions. You also agree that all information you provide to register with this Website or otherwise, including, but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features on the Website, is governed by our Privacy Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy. For more details about the use of the Website, please see Section 16 (Use of the Website) and Section 17 (Restrictions and Prohibitions).

5. Rewards Programs
Almedia may offer one or more rewards programs ("Rewards Programs") under which you may have the opportunity to receive points that are also referred to as coins, dollar amounts, points, and other credits/rewards (collectively, "Rewards") related to your participation in or interaction with various game offers, advertising, content, shopping opportunities, special offers, surveys, coupons, location-based deals, and other Rewards opportunities (collectively, "Offers").
Regardless of whether they are expressed as points or dollar amounts, Rewards have no cash, monetary, or other value and are only redeemable for gift cards or other prizes or redemption methods as may be offered by the Rewards Program from time to time (collectively, "Redemption Prizes"), subject to these Terms of Services and the Rewards Program redemption requirements at the time of redemption.
5a. Cashback
If Almedia offers a cashback program, the Cashback Terms apply in addition to these Terms of Service. These specifically govern the eligibility requirements, tracking, crediting, and payout of cashback. Cashback is an optional feature and may be available only in certain regions or for certain users. In the event of any conflict between these Terms of Service and the Cashback Terms, the Cashback Terms shall prevail.

Gift Cards may be offered independently of Cashback. Where Gift Cards are purchased, the Gift Cards section of these Terms applies in addition to the Cashback Terms.

By using the cashback program for the first time, you confirm that you have read and accepted the Cashback Terms. 

6. Rewards Have No Monetary Value and Are Nontransferable
You agree and acknowledge that unredeemed Rewards in your Account have no cash, monetary, or other value, remain the sole property of Almedia, and are only redeemable for such Redemption Prizes as Almedia may elect to offer in the Rewards Program from time to time, subject to these Terms of Services and the Rewards Program redemption requirements at the time of redemption.

7. Rewards
You may receive Rewards in a Rewards Program by participating in various Offers, as described in the applicable Rewards Program. Subject to the other provisions of these Terms of Services, Almedia will deposit any Rewards for Offers that you choose to participate in and successfully complete into the account that you established when you joined the Rewards Program (the "Account").
Rewards are deemed successfully completed once you have fully and properly satisfied all of the requirements of the Offer in the manner specified in the Offer (including any time limitations or waiting periods for acceptance or completion of the Offer) and in compliance with these Terms of Services, and Almedia and/or its third-party Rewards Program partners are able to properly validate, track and your record.
For avoidance of doubt, Almedia shall not be responsible for, nor shall Almedia be obligated to award Rewards to you for, any Offer that is not properly recorded, tracked, validated and/or deemed a successfully completed Reward under Almedia's and/or its third-party Rewards Program affiliates' policies, procedures and systems. In some instances, Almedia's third-party Rewards Program affiliates, rather than Almedia, may make the final determination of whether an Offer has been successfully completed and thereby should result in a Reward.
Please be sure to review all applicable terms of Offers and Rewards before deciding whether or not you would like to participate. We also reserve the right to: (i) change or limit the Offers or Rewards available or your ability to participate in certain Offers or the Rewards Program itself, (ii) change or limit the eligibility for or allowable frequency of Offers, and (iii) change or limit the number or type of Rewards you can receive for a given Offer or during a given time period. All such changes or limitations shall apply to all past, present, or future Rewards, unless otherwise expressly stated.
8. Redeeming Rewards
Subject to the other provisions of these Terms of Services, you may redeem accumulated Rewards in your Account for Redemption Prizes pursuant to the applicable Rewards Program redemption requirements at the time of redemption.
Supplies of Redemption Prizes may be limited. Redemption Prizes may be awarded or redeemed on a first come, first serve and while-supplies-last basis. If you attempt to redeem Rewards for a Redemption Prize and Almedia determines that the Redemption Prize is unavailable, out of stock, or for whatever reason cannot be provided to you, Almedia may, in its sole and absolute discretion, provide you with a Redemption Prize of equal or greater value.
All redemptions are final, and rewards may not be returned for credit except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Services or as otherwise agreed to in writing by an authorized representative of Almedia.
No re-crediting, reversal, or refund of Rewards will be issued for any reason after Rewards have been successfully redeemed. Once you order and receive a Redemption Prize, you may not reverse or cancel the Redemption Prize transaction or return the Redemption Prize for a refund or re-crediting of Rewards to your Account.
We have a right temporarily to hold any offer credits up to 90 days after an Offer has been completed.
9. Verifying Identity and Eligibility
Almedia reserves the right to verify your identity to our complete satisfaction prior to crediting or allowing redemption of any Rewards, issuing or delivering any Redemption Prizes in any Rewards Program, or otherwise providing you with access to or any benefit associated with the Website and features, or your Account. We may do so by requesting - either directly or indirectly via a third-party verification service - that you provide a clear, valid, complete, current, and readable photocopy of your passport, driver's license, or state ID card, by requiring you to verify the mobile phone number associated with your Account, or by such other proof of identity or eligibility as we may require. Some of our services or Redemption Prizes may have additional eligibility requirements and, in that case, Almedia also reserves the right to determine or verify your eligibility using such methods as it deems appropriate. Failure or refusal to provide requested documentation or proof of identity or eligibility is grounds for denying access to or any benefit associated with the Website or your Account.

Almedia will make commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate verification, but is not obligated to re-attempt or process repeated submissions more than a reasonable number of times, and may close or deny verification if it cannot be completed within a reasonable timeframe.

10. Redemption Prizes
Redemption Prizes are digital and delivered electronically to the email address then associated with your Account or as otherwise provided in the applicable Rewards Program.
Where we are unable to deliver a Redemption Prize or it goes unclaimed for whatever reason, you hereby direct and authorize us, where possible, to cancel or reverse the redemption for that Redemption Prize and restore the associated Rewards to your Account in the applicable Rewards Program, so that you can attempt to redeem such Rewards again in the future; provided, however, that we shall not be liable to you for any inability or failure to cancel or reverse the redemption and restore the associated Rewards to your Account.
10a. Gift Cards
10a.1 Almedia may offer digital gift cards (“Gift Cards”) for purchase through the Website or App in certain regions or for certain users. The availability, denominations, participating issuers or merchants, and applicable conditions for Gift Cards may vary and will be displayed at the point of purchase.

10a.2 Gift Cards may be purchased using the payment methods made available at checkout and are delivered digitally (e.g. by email or via the App). Almedia reserves the right to apply reasonable fraud, payment, and identity verification measures prior to issuing or delivering a Gift Card. If a transaction cannot be successfully verified or is reasonably suspected to be fraudulent, Almedia may refuse, suspend, or cancel the transaction. Payments for Rewards, Cashback payouts and Geschenkkarten are processed via regulated third-party payment service providers. Almedia itself does not provide payment services. Payment processing may be subject to additional verification and fraud-prevention checks by such providers.

10a.3 Gift Cards are sold by Almedia as a reseller and are redeemable solely with the respective issuer or merchant, subject to the issuer’s applicable terms and conditions. Almedia is not the issuer of the Gift Cards and is not responsible for the goods or services provided by the issuer, nor for the issuer’s refusal or inability to honor a Gift Card in accordance with its terms and conditions.

10a.4 Payments for Gift Cards are processed via regulated third-party payment service providers. Almedia itself does not provide payment services. Payment processing may be subject to additional verification and fraud-prevention checks by such providers.

10a.5 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Gift Card purchases are final. Gift Cards cannot be cancelled, exchanged, returned, or refunded once delivered (including where a Gift Card code has been issued).

10a.6 The risk of loss of a Gift Card passes to the user upon digital delivery. Users are responsible for safeguarding Gift Card codes against unauthorized use. Almedia is not responsible for loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized redemption of Gift Cards after delivery.

10a.7 In the event of suspected fraud, abuse, chargebacks, payment reversals, or other violations of these Terms, Almedia may suspend or cancel Gift Card transactions, deactivate Gift Cards, and/or withhold or reverse associated benefits, including Rewards or Cashback (if applicable).

10a.8 Users are responsible for any personal taxes, duties, or similar charges associated with the purchase or use of Gift Cards, unless expressly stated otherwise at the point of purchase or required by applicable law.

10a.9 Where Gift Cards are offered in connection with a Cashback program, the Cashback Terms apply in addition to this Section. In the event of any conflict, the specific provisions governing Gift Cards in these Terms of Service shall prevail with respect to the purchase, delivery, and use of Gift Cards.

11. Inactive Accounts
Any Account that has not been logged into and Rewards either received or redeemed for one (1) year or more may be deemed inactive and the Account closed. We may also modify our inactive Account rules and policies in our Rewards Programs from time to time, and if your Account becomes inactive pursuant to such then-current rules or policies, we may close your Account accordingly, without any compensation or further obligation to you regarding the closed Account. If you have any questions or concerns regarding these actions or wish to request Account reactivation (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we may impose from time to time), please contact us at support@freecash.com.

12. Rewards Expiration
We may also adopt or modify our Rewards expiration rules and policies for any past, present, or future Rewards from time to time, and if your Rewards expire pursuant to such then-current rules or policies, we may remove such Rewards from your Account, without any compensation or further obligation to you regarding the expired Rewards. If you have any questions or concerns regarding these actions or wish to request re-crediting of the expired points to your Account (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we may impose from time to time), please contact us at support@freecash.com.

13. Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions
Any sweepstakes, contests, or promotions (collectively, "Promotions") that may be offered via any of the Website and features or our services may be governed by additional promotional terms of Services ("Additional Promotional Terms"), including but not limited to official rules, which may set out eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions, terms and conditions, and details governing how your personal information may be used. In the event there is a conflict between these Terms of Services and Additional Promotional Terms, the Additional Promotional Terms shall prevail.
It is your responsibility to read any applicable Additional Promotional Terms to determine whether or not you want to or are eligible to participate, enter or register in or for the Promotions. By participating in a Promotion, you agree to comply with and abide by such Additional Promotional Terms and the decisions of the sponsor(s) of the Promotions you select.
You understand and agree that the sponsors or partners of the Promotions may have their own terms and conditions. Please review their terms and conditions carefully.
14. Taxes
You acknowledge and agree that we do not have the ability, in every instance, to determine whether or not the Rewards you received or redeemed in any Rewards Program are considered reportable income or taxable earnings in your jurisdiction. You are therefore responsible for any and all tax liability arising from or associated with your use of the Website and/or participating in the Rewards Program, including liability arising from your accrual of Rewards or your redemption of such Rewards. As a condition of your continued use of the Website and our services, we reserve the right to require you to provide necessary tax reporting information if our records show that you are or may be required to report the value of your redeemed Rewards to an appropriate tax authority. We encourage you, and it is your responsibility, to seek the advice of a tax expert in order to determine the tax consequences of your use of the Website and the Rewards Program, and any associated Rewards received or redeemed.
